# Week 1: Object Oriented Design #(OOD): Boris Bikes

#This project objective is to teach us two very important concepts of software development, pair programming skills and test driven design while working on the BorisBikes challenge:

#Collaboration (Pair Programming)
#Testing (TDD)
#I worked with various members of my cohort on this, the first day with Adrian Eyre, the second with Samuel-Adusei....

#On day 1 we were given the task to set up a project called Boris Bikes and run through a few concepts of TDD using rspec and how to set up fail challenges in order to create the project.

#Day 4 I worked with Joe.
