### Week 1: Object Oriented Design #(OOD): Boris Bikes

###This project objective is to teach us two very important concepts of software development, pair programming skills and test driven design while working on the BorisBikes challenge:

Collaboration (Pair Programming)
Testing (TDD)

On day 1 we were given the task to set up a project called Boris Bikes and run through a few concepts of TDD using rspec and how to set up fail challenges in order to create the project.
